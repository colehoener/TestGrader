Known Issues)
    Tabulate and grading gets a little funky when you start adding multiple tests and having responses out of order. Also tabulate does not work for matching but does for everything else. If you have 1 test /survey and 1 set of responses it works fine.
    With that said, I fixed the issues/points I got off for part B. I tested everything but something may have slipped through the cracks.

    Other than that, it should be good.

Comments)
    *These are just a few comments of what I know can be improved upon or anything else I wanted to say.

    1. The matching questions when they are displayed is not formatted very nice but it is still readable.
    2. All the prompts or any text that appears does not match the instructions exactly but is adjusted to
    system in place. It all has the same meaning but may just be slightly different.
    3. I included a sample test adn a sample survey with responses. Feel free to use those.
