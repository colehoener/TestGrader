# Test Grader & Survey Taker

This project was to learn and practice making class diagrams for an object-oriented system. 

This system allows users to:

1. Create
2. Modify
3. Take
4. Grade (tests only)
5. Tabulate
6. View results
7. Save
8. Load

for both tests and surveys.

The importance of this project is not so much the actual code, but the way it is structured and designed.
